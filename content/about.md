>Asset Cards was created out of a need for something that didn’t exist: a fun, portable, fast-paced card game that teaches you how to manage money, escape the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle, and build wealth — all without a game board, complicated rules, or hour-long commitment.

### About the Game
Asset Cards is a fast-paced, pocket-sized card game that sneakily teaches you how to escape the paycheck-to-paycheck trap. Each turn, you collect your pay, draw a card, and act—buy assets, pay off loans, invest in shares, or scramble to cover an unexpected bill. The goal? Build enough passive income to outpace your expenses and achieve financial freedom before anyone else does. Simple to learn, surprisingly competitive, and secretly educational—Asset Cards turns money smarts into a game night win. One deck, four players, infinite “aha!” moments.

Inspired by games like Cashflow, Uno Flip, and Monopoly Deal, Asset Cards takes the best elements of financial gameplay and packs them into a 20-minute, pick-up-and-play experience. Unlike games where you crush your opponents, Asset Cards is “you vs yourself” — a challenge to beat your bad habits and build the financial life you want.

### Why it works
Asset Cards introduces players to:

||
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Assets** | Businesses, properties, and shares | | **Expenses/Liabilities** | Food, travel, dependent, and recuring expenses |
| **Income Types** | Active (job) vs Passive (assets) | | **Loans** | Principal, interest, taking out and paying off |
| **Taxes** | and the economy | | **Financial Risks** | Shares, audits, upkeep costs |
||

**106** - Game Cards, **46** - Assets, **1** - Race

In Asset Cards, every paycheque is a choice: Invest, save, and spend — or survive. Outwit your expenses and grow your passive income until you’re financially free. Through clever gameplay and replayable randomness, players learn without even realising they’re learning. It’s fun first, financial education second — and that’s what makes it powerful. One deck, four players, infinite “aha!” moments.

### About the Creator

{{< figure src="/images/daniel.jpg" width="40%" alt="Daniel">}} 
Hi, I’m Daniel Hicks — and I created Asset Cards to solve a problem I kept seeing again and again: Too many people are smart, capable, and hard-working… but still feel stuck in the paycheque-to-paycheque cycle. And the worst part? Most of us were never taught how money actually works.

After trying every finance game I could get my hands on, I realised none of them truly hit the mark for what people really needed:
 
- A short, engaging game that teaches real financial concepts
- A game that focuses on building yourself up, not tearing others down
- And something easy to bring into a classroom, home, or youth centre — without needing a board, a massive rulebook, or two hours to play

So I designed Asset Cards to fill that gap — a portable, fast-paced game that teaches you how to think about money like someone who’s *financially free*.
